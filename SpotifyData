-- I first obtained the data from Kaggle and then created a table which could be used to import the data into SQLite --
-- After importing the data into the table I created, I began to analyze the data --
-- Below are descriptions of what information I queried for and the commands I used to query the data --


-- selected the first 20 rows of data to get a sense of what the data in the table looked like --
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata LIMIT 20;

-- counted how many times artists appeared in the Top 50 and ordered the list by descending order --
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- selected all information in the table for artists named Olivia Rodrigo --
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';

-- selected the name of artists, their track names, and the popularity rating of their track for all artists whose track had a popularity score above 90 --
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

-- calculated the average popularity and energy scores for all artists in the Top 50. Ordered results by most energetic to least energetic --
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(energy) DESC;

-- calculated the range of popularity scores in the table --
SELECT MIN(popularity), MAX(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
